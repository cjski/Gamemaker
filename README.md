# GameMaker

These are the entries for the 2015 and 2016 Sheridan GameMaker competition that I worked on. They are some of the first projects that I worked on related to software design and video game development, and I unfortunately don't have the source code, but they were fun projects and I learned a lot about game design from them. Feel free to download the `.exe` files above and try them out! Jester's Rampage is the full game, and Mansion Buster is an intermediate demo.

## Jesters Rampage

This was the 2015 GameMaker competition entry, and it was about a Jester who snapped and went for his revenge to the king, based on the theme of "Knights". The game plays as a platformer with several small enemies the Jester can attack with his knives, and a final boss to fight at the end!

## Mansion Buster

This was the 2016 GameMaker competition entry, about a small boy who has to clear out a haunted mansion filled with numerous scary bosses, based on the theme of "Nightmare". This game is a Top-Down shooter and features several rooms with minor enemies to fight, followed by a unique boss fight at the end of each!
